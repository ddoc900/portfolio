David's Porfolio Project

==========================

intro:

this is my first ever readme file. I'm basing this off of what others look like on github


========================

goal:

the purpose of this prioject is to deploy a website that displays who iam and what my background looks like.
More importantly, this will be my biggiest and most compleate proejct yet. After starting coading about 1 year ago today in 
the fall of 2021, finally, I have enough of a base knowlege to make a basic website.
